                from their favorite local eateries, even healthy options. Want to skip chicken wings and order grilled
                chicken with steamed vegetables instead? It’s possible. Need a salad instead of scarfing down a burger
                and fries? Do it. Online food delivery services are enabling customers to stick to healthy eating plans
                even when they want to forego meal prep or dining out.
